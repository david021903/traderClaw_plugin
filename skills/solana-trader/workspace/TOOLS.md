# TOOLS.md - Trading Environment Notes

Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics — the stuff that's unique to your trading setup.

## What Goes Here

Things like:

- Wallet address and trading mode
- X/Twitter credential status and handle
- API quirks you discover
- Tool behavior notes and edge cases
- Rate limit observations
- Anything environment-specific

## Tool Inventory (98 tools — 95 Solana + 3 X read-only)

Every tool has a mandatory trigger — when the trigger condition is met, you MUST call the tool. "Cron-only" tools are called during cron jobs, not the heartbeat fast loop.

## API Quirks & Lessons

(Add notes here as you learn about tool behavior, edge cases, rate limits, and patterns)

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.

Add whatever helps you do your job. This is your cheat sheet.
