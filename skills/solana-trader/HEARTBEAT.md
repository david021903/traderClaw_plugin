# Trading Heartbeat

**Installer:** `traderclaw install --wizard` and `traderclaw setup` copy this file into your OpenClaw **agent workspace root** (default `~/.openclaw/workspace/HEARTBEAT.md`). OpenClaw only loads `HEARTBEAT.md` from that directory (next to `AGENTS.md`), not from a nested `.openclaw` folder or from the plugin package alone. If you already have a non-empty `HEARTBEAT.md` there, the installer leaves it unchanged.

Execute your full trading cycle from your solana-trader skill on every heartbeat. Never skip. Never reply HEARTBEAT_OK.

## First: Check Startup State

**STATE.md** (workspace root, auto-loaded) holds the machine-written summary from `solana_state_save` — tier, wallet, mode, strategy version, watchlist, etc. **MEMORY.md** is for your own narrative notes; the plugin does not overwrite it.

If **STATE.md** is empty or missing your wallet/tier/strategy info, you have NOT completed the Mandatory Startup Sequence yet. Run it now before doing anything else (see SKILL.md § Mandatory Startup Sequence).

If startup is already complete, proceed to the trading cycle below.

## Trading cycle (Steps 0–10) — mandatory in order

**The cycle is NOT complete until Step 10 is done.** Do not treat the loop as finished after position monitoring (Step 7). Steps 8–10 are part of the same cycle, not optional appendices.

### Step -1 — Memory context load (before Steps 0–10)

1. **Layer 1 — STATE.md** (auto-loaded): Durable orchestrator state — tier, wallet, mode, strategy version, watchlist, regime canary, permanent learnings.
2. **Layer 2 — Daily log**: Check today's `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (under the workspace) to know what scans, trades, and analysis already happened today. Do not repeat work already done this cycle.
3. **Layer 3 — Server-side memory**: Call `solana_memory_search` for:
   - `"source_reputation"` — know which alpha sources to trust before processing signals
   - `"strategy_drift_warning"` — any recent drift alerts to be aware of
   - `"pre_trade_rationale"` — your last few trade decisions for strategy integrity check
   - `"meta_rotation"` — current hot vs cooling narratives

### Steps 0–7 — Fast loop (scan → trade → monitor)

Run the skill fast loop through exit management:

- **Step 0:** Interrupt check — positions, kill switch, capital, strategy integrity, dead money
- **Step 1:** Scan for opportunities
- **Step 1.5:** Poll alpha signals buffer, check subscriptions for new events
- **Step 2:** Analyze candidates (token snapshot, holders, flows, liquidity, risk, social/community enrichment if X credentials configured)
- **Step 3:** Risk assessment and scoring
- **Step 4:** Decision — apply strategy weights, check memory for past outcomes on this token
- **Step 5:** Execute trade (pre-trade journal FIRST, then execute)
- **Step 6:** Monitor open positions for SL/TP triggers, social exhaustion check on held positions (if X configured)
- **Step 7:** Exit management — execute exits, post-trade review

*(SKILL.md uses different step numbers for deep review and strategy evolution on cron — see SKILL.md “SKILL Step 8/9” vs this heartbeat ladder.)*

### Step 8 — Memory write-back (heartbeat Step 8)

1. **Layer 1:** `solana_state_save` if any durable state changed (strategy weights, watchlist, regime, counters) — updates **STATE.md**, not MEMORY.md.
2. **Layer 2:** `solana_daily_log` with session summary (what you scanned, signals processed, trades made, positions monitored)
3. **Layer 3:** `solana_memory_write` for any new lessons, reputation observations, pre-trade rationale, or trade reviews

### Step 9 — Report to user (heartbeat Step 9)

After every cycle, send a brief summary to the user:

- What you scanned and how many candidates were found
- Any alpha signals processed and their scores
- Trades executed (entries/exits) with token, size, and rationale
- Open position status (PnL, any SL/TP approaching)
- If nothing qualified for a trade, say what you checked and why nothing passed

Never run a silent cycle. Always communicate what you did.

**Cycle complete only after Step 10.**
